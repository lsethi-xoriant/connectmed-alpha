<p><strong>III. Informed Consent</strong>
    Telemedicine is the delivery of health care services using interactive audio and video technology, where the patient and the health care professional are not in the same physical location. During your telemedicine consultation with a healthcare professional, details of your health history and personal health information may be discussed with you through the use of interactive video, audio and other telecommunications technology, and your healthcare professional may perform a physical examination through these technologies.<br>Our Services are not intended to replace a primary care physician relationship or be your permanent medical home. You should seek emergency help or follow-up care when recommended by a healthcare professional or when otherwise needed, and continue to consult with your primary care physician and other healthcare professionals as recommended.
</p>

    As with any medical procedure, there are potential risks associated with the use of telemedicine. These risks include, but may not be limited to:</p>

        <li>In rare cases, the healthcare professional may determine that the transmitted information is of inadequate quality, thus necessitating a rescheduled video consult.</li>
        <li>Delays in medical evaluation and treatment could occur due to deficiencies or failures of the equipment</li>
        <li>In very rare instances, security protocols could fail, causing a breach of privacy of personal medical information</li>
